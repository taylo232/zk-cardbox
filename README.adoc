# zk-cardbox
A zettelkasten using graph libraries

The aim is to build a working zettelkasten system built around plain text storage and learn about graph databases in the process.

The first step is to build a minimal graph db. Each 'card' to contain just a single UID and then learn how to link, visualise, manipulate.

All my projects follow either one or both of the the SCID principles: **S**low **C**omputing, **I**ntermittent **D**evelopment.

TODO:

. create simple commandline for to play
. build display and manipulation methods
. add fields per card (UID,title, tags, 'leads to', source, content)
. create plain text method
. display in a gui
. manage in a gui
