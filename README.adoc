# zk-cardbox
A zettelkassen using graph libraries

The aim is to build a working zettelkassen system built around plain text storage and learn about graph databases in the process.

All my projects follow the SCID methodology (**S**low **C**omputing, **I**ntermittent **D**evelopment)

. Build a minimal graph db. Each card to contain just a single UID.
. Learn how to link, visualise, manipulate

TODO:

. create simple commandline for to play
. build display and manipulation methods
. add fields per card (UID,title, tags, 'leads to', source, content)
. create plain text method
. display in a gui
. manage in a gui
