I _think_ the following methods _could_ be sufficient:

- _import networkx as nx_
- g = nx.MultiDiGraph()
- g.add_node(uid)
- g.add_edge(from, to)
- g.successors(uid)
- g.predecessors(uid)

Using text files per card is impractical. Start with pickles as temp. Move to JSON? +
Maybe a plaintext export? JSON?

Use single txt file and bulk read and write?

==== Thoughts

Use UID 'nodes and edges' as the *real* zk and use tags as a discovery tool to enable links to be made.

==== Features

- view card
- show adjacent network
- show wider network
- navigate to adjacent network
- create a new card
- edit a card (all fields except 'sys')
- add card links
- edit card links
- view predecessors and successors
- add extra links
- view notes by card tags
- show orphan cards
- show topology

==== Card Data

- (sys) UID
- (sys) datetime created
- (sys) datetime last modified
- Title
- Links (directional)
- Tag list
- Body
- Sources
