I _think_ the following methods _could_ be sufficient:

- _import networkx as nx_
- g = nx.MultiDiGraph()
- g.add_node(uid)
- g.add_edge(from, to)
- g.successors(uid)
- g.predecessors(uid)

==== Thoughts

Use UID 'nodes and edges' as the *real* zk and use tags as a discovery tool to enable links to be made.
